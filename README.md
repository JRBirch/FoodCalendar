# FoodCalendar
The aim of this application is to create a backend api for a FoodCalendar app. The idea being a user can attach different foods to a day on their calendar. The technologies I will utilise to write up the server side code include typescript, node, and express. I have plans to implement a nice frontend, but it will be basic to begin with. 

## Starting the Server
When developing to run the server in developer mode, in one terminal run:

`tsc -w` or `npm run devb`

Then in another terminal run the command: 

`nodemon ./dist/app` or `npm run dev`
